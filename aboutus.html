                <h3>We work with homeowners who are planning to live in their home long term, usually for ten or more
                    years.

                    They live in a home that is too small, or the layout or functionality of the house doesn’t work
                    anymore.
                    Or
                    maybe the
                    finishes are falling apart. Often they’ve bought the perfect starter home. But as the family grew
                    they
                    needed more
                    space, or to use the space in a different way.

                    They have considered moving, but staying in their current home makes more sense. They love their
                    neighbourhood, and
                    would prefer not to move.

                    They are looking for help with both design and construction, and would prefer to work with a single
                    firm
                    which will be
                    responsible for both design and construction.

                <h3>
                    For the past 15 years, homeowners have called us for solutions, and to design and build their
                    renovation,
                    house addition
                    or custom home.

                    Along the way, we've built a team which includes an in-house designer, project managers, and
                    carpenters.
                    We've been
                    nominated for several awards, and have won two best renovation awards.

                    We service the Greater Toronto Area and areas to north-west.
